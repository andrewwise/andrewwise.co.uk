<p>I'm away from my favourite person right now. Dani is away in Edinburgh for a few days with some friends. I think this might be the longest we've been apart for years. It's hard being apart, even if only for a few days. At first, it's just like a normal day when you don't see each other but once it's been a couple of days that's when it really starts to kick in. I just want to see her so much.</p>
<p>She's my soul mate, the light of my life, just her presences warms my heart. Not just my heart but when I'm around her I feel like I've just walked out from the shade and into the warmth of the sun on a perfect summer day. I couldn't imagine being without her.</p>
<p>I guess being apart really makes me appreciate how wonderful she is and how deeply I love her. I keeping thinking of the first moment I get to see her pretty face again and look into her beautiful eyes, longing for it even, when she gets back.</p>
<p>Tomorrow can't come soon enough.</p>
